# MawiCompass 🧭

A tiny, privacy-friendly GPS-free compass built with .NET MAUI.
Works anywhere—no internet, no accounts, no ads, no tracking.

- Uses the phone’s magnetometer + tilt compensation to show Magnetic North

- Optional True North mode via manual declination (east = +, west = −)

- Haptic “snap” when you align to N/E/S/W

- Interference warning if magnetic readings look off

- Smooth, dark UI with a red north needle, minor ticks every 10°, and an info page

Why GPS-free? It still points north even if GPS is jammed, spoofed, or offline.
